# auto-garage-image-client

Production: `https://auto-garage-image-client.herokuapp.com/`

This is an anonymous voting app where you can create votes, vote, and see the results of a vote. 

This app uses React and graphql on the frontend, Node and graphql on the backend, and SQl for the DB. Each poll has a unique id that gives someone access to vote or see the results. 

To run this app, pull down the main branch and run `yarn build` then `yarn start`


1.    Effectively use conditional logic, JavaScript array methods, and front-end framework elements to render large lists on the web client.

2.    Work with the proper libraries (e.g. VueJS, React) to create and manage the front-end portion of your project using a real development toolset.

3.    Work with NPM and NodeJS to create and manage the back-end portion of your project.

4.    "Seed" script provides way to populate the datastore after the Docker install and launch.

5.    Properly use Git for your source version control with an established record of commits.

6.    Present a User Interface route or "page" that allows the user to: 

1.    CREATE a meaningful (at least 5 data fields) resource through a REST endpoint that is stored in the datastore

2.    Read or GET meaningful data from 3 different REST endpoints

3.    UPDATE at least 1 portion of meaningful data through the appropriate endpoint

4.    DELETE some resource via the proper endpoint

7.    Present a separate User Interface route or "page" that allows the user to:

1.    CREATE a meaningful (at least 5 data fields) resource through a GraphQL endpoint that is stored in the datastore

2.    Read or GET meaningful data from with at least 3 different query options from the GraphQL endpoint.

3.    UPDATE at least 1 portion of meaningful data through an appropriate GraphQL mutation.

4.    DELETE some resource using a proper GraphQL mutation.

8.    You will submit the GitHub URL for your project with a detailed ReadMe explaining how to install and run your server(s) on Docker or from your deployed sites.
